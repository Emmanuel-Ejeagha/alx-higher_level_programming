# MagicClass - Python Class README

Welcome to the `MagicClass` Python class! This class is designed to perform various calculations related to circles. It encapsulates the functionality to compute the area and circumference of a circle based on its radius. This class is inspired by a specific set of bytecode instructions and offers a flexible and powerful way to work with circles in your code.

## Features

The `MagicClass` offers the following features:

### Initialization

The class allows you to create instances with a specific radius. The radius must be a number (integer or float) and must be provided during initialization. It is important to note that the radius is stored as a private attribute within the class.

### Area Calculation

You can compute the area of the circle using the `area` method. It leverages the formula `area = pi * radius^2` to calculate the area of the circle. The mathematical constant `pi` is provided by the `math` module.

### Circumference Calculation

The `circumference` method lets you calculate the circumference of the circle. It employs the formula `circumference = 2 * pi * radius` to determine the circumference of the circle.

## Getting Started

To start using the `MagicClass` in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [alx-higher_level_programming](https://github.com/yourusername/alx-higher_level_programming)
2. Navigate to the `0x06-python-classes` directory.
3. Import the `MagicClass` into your Python code using the following syntax:
   
   ```python
   from 103-magic_class import MagicClass
   ```

4. Create an instance of the class with a specific radius:

   ```python
   circle = MagicClass(5)  # Create a circle with radius 5
   ```

5. Utilize the various methods available to compute the area and circumference:

   ```python
   area = circle.area()  # Calculate the area of the circle
   circumference = circle.circumference()  # Calculate the circumference of the circle
   ```

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the `MagicClass` to perform circle-related calculations:

```python
from 103-magic_class import MagicClass

# Create a circle with radius 7
circle = MagicClass(7)

# Calculate and print the area
area = circle.area()
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area}")

# Calculate and print the circumference
circumference = circle.circumference()
print(f"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference}")
```

## Why Use MagicClass?

The `MagicClass` is designed to offer a convenient and efficient way to work with circle calculations. It encapsulates the necessary logic and leverages the power of Python's `math` module to perform accurate computations. By using this class, you can streamline your code and focus on higher-level tasks without worrying about the intricate calculations involved in circle properties.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different radius values to see how the `MagicClass` handles the calculations effortlessly.

Happy coding! íº€
