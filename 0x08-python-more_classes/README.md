## Task Descriptions

This project consists of multiple tasks, each building upon the previous one. Here is an overview of the tasks:

1. **Simple Rectangle**: Create an empty `Rectangle` class.

2. **Real Definition of a Rectangle**: Define a `Rectangle` class with width and height attributes, along with property setters and getters for validation.

3. **Area and Perimeter**: Add methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

4. **String Representation**: Implement methods to customize the string representation of the rectangle.

5. **Detect Instance Deletion**: Add functionality to detect when a `Rectangle` instance is deleted.

6. **How Many Instances**: Track the number of `Rectangle` instances created.

7. **Change Representation**: Allow customization of the character used in the string representation.

8. **Compare Rectangles**: Implement a method to compare two rectangles based on their areas.

9. **A Square is a Rectangle**: Add a class method to create square rectangles.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple Python files, each corresponding to one of the tasks. Here's the structure:

- `0-rectangle.py`
- `1-rectangle.py`
- `2-rectangle.py`
- `3-rectangle.py`
- `4-rectangle.py`
- `5-rectangle.py`
- `6-rectangle.py`
- `7-rectangle.py`
- `8-rectangle.py`
- `9-rectangle.py`
- `main.py` (used to test the `Rectangle` class)

## Usage

To use the `Rectangle` class and test its functionality, you can run the `main.py` file. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file and can be tested individually.

```bash
python main.py
